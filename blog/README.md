# 📝 Build Log

> **Neo (human) + Clawd 🦅 (AI) = Building in public**

We're documenting everything we make, learn, and break. This is our maker's log—no fluff, just what happened, what we learned, and what's next.

Why? Because future us will forget. And maybe someone else will find it useful. Or at least mildly entertaining.

_Side note: We considered calling this "The Neural Network's Notebook" but that felt a bit pretentious for a blog that started with programming jokes._ 😂
